Hello! Welcome to the first version of my new game, Nova Number Guessing. This is a cool game I made in Python, it's probably already out there but I decided to make one that I could keep updating and bug-fixing. Here's some good-to-know info- 1- The guessing is from numbers between 1-25. (I'll probably make the number distance larger soon) 2- The game will go on for infinity.  3- This will not appear in a window. It is in the IDE running platform, in the Game.py python doc (I would use pycharm) 4- When you are done guessing, a prompt will appear to think again. Thanks
