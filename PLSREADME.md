Hello! Welcome to the first version of my new game, Nova Number Guessing.
This is a cool game I made in Python, it's probably already out there but I decided to make one that I could keep updating and bug-fixing. Here's some good-to-know info-
1- The guessing is from numbers between 1-25. (I'll probably make the number distance larger soon)
2- You can play again by rerunning the program when you get it right.
3- This will not appear in a window. It is in the IDE running platform, in the Game.py pythondoc
4- When you are done guessing, a prompt will appear to guess again.
Thanks
